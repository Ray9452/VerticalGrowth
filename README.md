Here we submitt all the code and data used in the paper "Biofilm Vertical Growth Dynamics Are Captured by An Active Fluid Framework" Ray Copeland and Peter Yunker 2025. 
To run this, simply run the "AllCode.jl" file. Currently it assumes that End_data.jld2 and Fit_data.jld2 already exist in the current directory. The toml files inclue the needed packages. 
FluidCode.jl incorportates the model derived in the paper. database.csv is the data gathered from "Vertical growth dynamics of biofilms" Bravo et al. 2023.
